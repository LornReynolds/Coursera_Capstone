# Business Location Selection Optimization Through Data
## Lorn Reynolds
### Introduction
  Entrepreneurism is the backbone to today’s society.  According to the Small Business Association, 66% of small businesses will survive their first 2 years. Half of businesses fail within the first year. The success of a business depends largely on its location. So you must carefully choose an ideal location because this can be the determinant between the success and failure of your business (Gaille, n.d.).  Although more and more businesses in today’s economic arena are no longer location-dependent, Forbes states that “location is everything” for many types of small businesses. (Craig, n.d.)  

  The importance of location cannot be understated.  Foursquare data can be leveraged to identify potential locations for prospective businesses.  Based on the business type, existing businesses of the same genre within a specified radius, the existing businesses' ratings, and numerous other attributes available from Foursquare, recommendations on location can be made to clients backed by data.  Potentially, this data could be cross referenced with Multiple Listing Service (MLS) records to determine available properties within those areas.  Using Foursquare and other similar data sources, potential entrepreneurs can make decisions that could mean the difference between success and failure.
